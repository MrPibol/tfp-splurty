        href="http://github.com/KenMazaika">Ken</a>. Two web developers who are on a mission to give people the

        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
        Together they taught hundreds of students how to code and build products people want at places like Harvard Business         
        School, Carnegie Mellon, Babson, Rhode Island School of Design, Brown University, Punohou High School and â€˜Iolani High

            <!--The approach followed is mobile-first, we first design for the smallest screen by defining the smallest case with col-*(no extra letters)-->
            <!--In the next step, we define the next screen with sm (sm will take over as soon as the size of the browser window is big enough-->
